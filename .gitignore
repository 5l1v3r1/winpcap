#
# This file is tracked by git for the winpcap repository, and thus should
# only contain ignore entries common to all WinPcap developers. To ignore
# files specific to your local repository, for example files generated by
# your editor, add them to your repository exclude file (.git/info/exclude)
# or your global ~/.gitignore_global. For details see:
#   https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files
