1. Download the winpcap_oem and winpcap CVS repositories and put them in the same folder

2. Edit winpcap\Common\WpcapNames.h to set the name that this version of winpcap OEM
   will have.

3. Copy the PacketAndWan project from \winpcap_oem\packetNtx\Dll\Project\ to \winpcap\packetNtx\Dll\Project\

4. Copy Compile2k_oem.bat and CompileNT4_oem.bat from \winpcap_oem\packetNtx\ to \winpcap\packetNtx\

5. Build the Windows NT4 driver using CompileNT4_oem.bat. Build the Windows 2000 driver using Compile2k_oem.bat.

6. build the Windows 2000 packet.dll using the PacketAndWan project

7. build the Windows NT4 packet.dll using the standard project, selecting the following configuration:

PacketNT - Win32 NT4 OEM

8. Copy the drivers and dlls to WinpcapOem\binaries\

9. Open the WinpcapOem.dsw project file. This project can be used to build both the standard
   and the security-enabled version of WinPcap OEM. The security-enabled version requires among
   the resources the file with the checksums of the executables that will be accepted.

10. Compile winpcap OEM. Be sure to do a "rebuild all", otherwise the resources will not be updated.
    NOTE: the WinpcapOem.dsw build process will overwrite the packet.lib file in winpcap\common\.
    The result of the buils process is the OEM version of packet.dll

11. Add the following lines to wpcap's Win32-Extensions.c:

int pcap_start_oem(char** err_str)
{
	if(PacketStartOem(err_str) == 0)
	{
		return -1;
	}
	return 0;
}

12. Add the following line to the wpcap def file:

pcap_start_oem

13. Recompile wpcap. 
    The result is the OEM version of wpcap.dll
