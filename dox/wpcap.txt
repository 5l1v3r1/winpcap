/** @defgroup wpcap wpcap developer's manual
 *  @{

\htmlonly<p>This section contains the user manual of wpcap, the highest level of
the two WinPcap libraries. Wpcap is a dll with a set of high level system independent functions for packet
capture and network analysis. These functions allow to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>obtain the list of the available network adapters
  <li>retrieve various information about an adapter, like the description and the list of addresses</li>
  <li>sniff the packets using one of the network interfaces of the PC</li>
  <li>send packets to the network
  <li>save packets to disk and load them with an interface similar to the one of
    live capture</li>
  <li>create packet filters from an high level language and associate them with
    a capture</li>
</ul>
<p>wpcap.dll is compatible with libpcap, the well known packet capture library
for Unix. This compatibility allows to easily write portable network tools that
will work on the whole Win32 OS family and on all the major Unix flavors.</p>
<p>Several portions of the manuals present in this section derive directly from the man pages of
tcpdump and libpcap, maintained by the tcpdump.org developers. Therefore, if you
are looking for updated docs, you can consult the web site <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org">www.tcpdump.org</a>.</p>
