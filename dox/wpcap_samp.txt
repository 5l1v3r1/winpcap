<h2>How to create an application that uses wpcap.dll</h2>
<p>To create an application that uses wpcap.dll, follow the next steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Include the file <i>pcap.h</i> at the beginning of every source file that
    uses the functions exported by library.</li>
  <li>Set the options of the linker to include the <i>wpcap.lib</i> library
    file. <i>wpcap.lib</i> is generated compiling the wpcap source code and can
    be found in the developer's pack.
  <li>Set the options of the linker to include the winsock library file (for
    example <i>wsock32.lib</i>). This file is distributed with the C compiler
    and contains the socket functions for Windows. It is needed by some libpcap
    functions.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Remember that</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To add a new library to the project with Microsoft Visual C++, you must
    select <em>Settings</em> from the <em>Project</em> menu, then select <em>Link</em>
    from the tab control, and then add the name of the new library in the <em>Objcet/library
    modules</em> editbox.
  <li>To add a new path where Microsoft Visual C++ will look for the libraries,
    you must select <em>Options</em> from the <em>Tools</em> menu, then <em>Link</em>
    from the tab control, <em>library files</em> from the <em>show directories
    for</em> combobox, and the add the path in the <em>directories</em> box.
  <li>To add a new path where Microsoft Visual C++ will look for the include
    files, you must select <em>Options</em> from the <em>Tools</em> menu, then <em>Link</em>
    from the tab control, <em>include files</em> from the <em>show directories
    for</em> combobox, and the add the path in the <em>directories</em> box.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sample programs</h2>
<p>A couple of sample programs are provided to show how to use wpcap.dll. The
source of the examples, along with all the files needed to compile and run
them, can be found in the <a href="http://netgoup.polito.it/winpcap/install/bin/WPdpack.zip">Developer's
Pack</a>.&nbsp; For didactic purpose we provide here a browsable
version of the code: it is possible to click on the variables and functions to jump the documentation of each of them.</p>

<p>This sample program reads the packets from a file or a network adapter,
depending on a command line switch. It prints the timestamp, the length and the
data of the packets. Once compiled, it can run on all the Win32 platforms. It can be compiled
to run on Unix as well (the makefile is provided).</p>
\endhtmlonly
\ref wpcapsamp2
\htmlonly
<p>This is a more complete example of libpcap usage. It shows, among other
things, how to create and set filters and how to save a capture to disk. It can
be compiled under Win32 or Unix (projects and makefiles are provided).
Pcap_filter (pf.exe)
is a general-purpose packet filter: it receives as input parameters a source of
packets (it can be a physical interface or a file), a filter and an output file.
It takes packets from the source until CTRL+C is pressed, applies the filter to
the incoming packets and saves them in the output file if they satisfy the
filter. Pcap_filter can be used to capture packets from network according to a
particular filter, but also to extract a set of packets from a previously saved
file. The format of input and output files is the libpcap one, i.e. same of
WinDump, tcpdump and many other network tools.</p>
