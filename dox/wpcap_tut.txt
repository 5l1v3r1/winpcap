/** @defgroup wpcap_tut WinPcap tutorial: a step by step guide to program WinPcap
 *  @{


This section shows how to program WinPcap, exploiting the main features of its API. It is organized as a tutorial, subdivided in a set of lessons that will guide the reader, step by step, inside the art of programming WinPcap, from the simple basic functions (obtining the adapters list, opening an adapter) to the more comple ones (sending queues, gathering traffic ststics). Several code snippets and tiny programs are provided as references: all of them are linked to the rest of the documentation, therefore it is possible to click on the functions and data structure to jump to their description.

All the samples are written in plain C, so a basic knowledge of C programming is required. Also, since this is a tutorial
on a library for raw networking, good knowledge of networks and protocols is assumed.
