=========================

This document explain how to 
- update the version
- compile the winpcap dlls (wpcap.dll, packet.dll, wanpacket.dll)
- compile the NPF driver (npf.sys)
- create the installer


Needed tools/libraries (32bit and 64bit AMD)
------------------------------

- Microsoft Visual Studio 6 + Service Pack 5 or 6
- Microsoft Platform SDK Febrary 2003 (more recent versions do not work with VS6)
- Microsoft Driver Development Kit for Windows 2003 SP1
- The cygnus environment on your path (needed to execute step 11 and 12).
  In particular you will need to have flex, bison, patch, touch.
- Doxygen 1.3.7 installed and on the path

How to compile WinPcap
------------------------------------------------

1.  Download winpcap (HEAD) from the CVS into %BUILD_TREE%
    NOTE: DO NOT USE A %BUILD_TREE% path containing spaces, the NT4 DDK build 
          gets screwed up with spaces in the paths!!

2.  Modify the version info into these files (version is x.y.0.z for release 
    versions, 1-2 for OEM, 99,98... for previews &co).
    If necessary, modify the copyright year.
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\version.h

3.  Modify the documentation version in the file
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\dox\prj\winpcap_noc.dox (the version is repeated once)

4.  Modify the device string into
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\common\wpcapnames.h (first two defines). It should be "NPF"

5.  Open 
	  %BUILd_TREE%\winpcap\install\installer\winpcap.nsi with an editor.

6.  Edit the following version defines
      !define WINPCAP_PRJ_MAJOR "4"
      !define WINPCAP_PRJ_MINOR "0"
      !define WINPCAP_PRJ_REV "0"
      !define WINPCAP_PRJ_BUILD "120"
      !define WINPCAP_PROJ_VERSION_DOTTED "4.0.0.120"
      !define WINPCAP_LEGAL_COPYRIGHT "© 2005 - 2006 CACE Technologies"
      !define WINPCAP_PRODUCT_NAME "WinPcap 4.0 alpha1"
      !define WINPCAP_COMPANY_NAME "CACE Technologies"
      !define WINPCAP_FILE_NAME "WinPcap_${WINPCAP_PRJ_MAJOR}_${WINPCAP_PRJ_MINOR}_alpha1.exe"

7.  Update the license year at the beginning of the file:
	  %BUILd_TREE%\winpcap\install\installer\license.txt 

8.  Commit 
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\version.h
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\dox\prj\winpcap_noc.dox
	  %BUILd_TREE%\winpcap\install\installer\license.txt 
	  %BUILd_TREE%\winpcap\install\installer\winpcap.nsi with an editor.
	
	into the CVS. These should be the *only* modified files in this module.

9.  Tag the %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap module with the tag 
	  WINPCAP_<MAJOR>_<MINOR>_<REV>_<BUILD>

10. Download the libpcap sources (usually 0_9 branch) into 
	  %BUILD_TREE%\libpcap_<libpcap_version>

11. Be sure that the sources of libpcap do *not* contain any CVS folder. The tarball usually
    contains the CVS folders if it's a daily snapshot. If any, remove them.

12. Take the contents of %BUILD_TREE%\libpcap_<version> and copy it into
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\wpcap\libpcap 

13. From the command line, go to folder 
      %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\wpcap\libpcap

14. On the command line, type "patch -p1 < remote_code.patch"

15. CD into %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\wpcap\prj and execute 
	  "build_scanner_parser.bat"	

16. CD into %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\wpcap\libpcap\win32\prj and execute
      "unix2dos libpcap.dsp"

17. Check that the version of libpcap in
      %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\wpcap\libpcap\pcap.c line 865
      "static const char pcap_version_string[] = "libpcap version 0.9[.x]";"
    makes sense (??? WHAT DOES IT MEAN???)

18. Check that the version of wpcap in  
      %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\wpcap\libpcap\pcap.c line 875
        "static const char wpcap_version_string[] = "3.1";"
    is correct. This is a sort of hardcoded patch. If we want to fix this number, we
    should patch the remote_code.patch file as well.

19. NOT DONE. At this point we should have rezipped the modified files to overwritten_files.zip.
     
20. Zip the contents of the two folders 
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap
	  %BUILD_TREE%\libpcap_<libpcap_version>
		  |
		  V
	  %BUILD_TREE%\sources.zip

21. Open a Win 2000 DDK Free build environment. Go into 
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\packetntx. 
	Execute "compileDriver.bat". Prefast 1.5.2402 should issue 8 warnings 
	(20060724). 
	Close the build environment.

22. Open the Win 2003 DDK free x64 build environment.  Go into 
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\packetntx. 
	Execute "compileDriver.bat". 
	Close the build environment.
	
23. Open the WinNT4 DDK Release build environment. Go into 
      %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\packetntx. 
    Execute "compileDriver.bat". 
    Close the build environment. 
	NOTE: TODO add how to check if the build was ok or not.

24. Open %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\packet9x\dll\project\packet.dsw with Visual Studio 6. 
	Go to Build->Batch Build, choose *all* the configurations and hit "rebuild all".
	[20060423]No warnings should be generated.
    Close Visual Studio.

25. Open %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\packetNtx\dll\project\packet.dsw with Visual Studio 6. 
	Go to Build->Batch Build, choose *all* the configurations and hit "rebuild all".
	[20060423]No warnings should be generated.
    Close Visual Studio.

26. Open %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\wpcap\prj\wpcap.dsw with Visual Studio 6. 
	Go to Build->Batch Build, choose *all* the configurations that do *not* contain "DAG" in their name, and hit "rebuild all".
	[20060423]A number of warnings are generated by all the libraries, ignore them.
	TODO we should get rid of them.
    Close Visual Studio.

27. Open %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\install\WinPcap Installer Helper\WinPcapInstallerHelper.dsw with Visual Studio 6. 
	Go to Build->Batch Build, choose *all* the configurations and hit "rebuild all".
	[20060423]No warnings should be generated.
    Close Visual Studio.

28. Cygwin compilation (needed for the developer's pack).
    Open a cygwin shell.

29. Go into 
	  %BUILD_TREE\winpcap\packetntx\dll\project
	
30. Type "make". It should spit out 3 warnings.

31. Go into 
	 %BUILD_TREE\winpcap\wpcap\PRJ

32. Type "make". A couple of warnings should be generated.

33. The build is complete.

How to create the installer for WinPcap
---------------------------------------
1.  Open a command prompt, go to 
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\install
    and execute "copy_installer_files.bat"
2.  Manually copy npf.vxd from a previous version of winpcap to
      %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\install\installer\distribution\9x.
3.  Open 
	  %BUILd_TREE%\winpcap\install\installer\winpcap.nsi with NSIS and create the installer. 
    NSIS will fail if not all the binaries have been created correctly.

How to create the developer's pack for WinPcap
----------------------------------------------

1.  After the build is completed, in a command prompt go to 
 	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap

2.  Run "build_wpdpack.bat". The script will pause after each step of the
    build:
	a. Creation of the include folder (no errors/warnings)
	b. Creation of the lib folder (no errors/warnings)
	c. Creation of the Examples and Examples-pcap folders (no errors/warnings)
	d. creation of the documentation. Some warnings/errors are generated:
	   - a Doxygen warning processing the file winpcap/dox/libpcap/funcs/pcap.h
	   

How to create the public sources zip file
-----------------------------------------
1.  Uncompress the file 
	  %BUILD_TREE\Sources.zip into a folder named 
	  %BUILD_TREE\Sources
	
2.  Delete the following folder:
	  %BUILD_TREE\Sources\winpcap\install

3.  Delete the following file:
	  %BUILD_TREE\Sources\winpcap\wpcap\libpcap\remote_overwritten_files.zip

4.  Delete the following folder:	
	  %BUILD_TREE\Sources\libpcap_<version>

5.  Perform a search under
	  %BUILD_TREE%\Sources\winpcap\
	and delete *all* the folders named "CVS".

6.  Done.
