WINPCAP PRO RELEASE PROCEDURE
=============================

NOTE (GV20070122): the procedure has NOT been tested thoroughly in case
of non-signed builds.

Needed tools
------------

- Visual Studio .NET 2003
- The cygnus environment on your path (needed to execute step 11 and 12).
   In particular you will need to have flex, bison, patch.
- Doxygen 1.5.1 installed and on the path

Dependencies
------------
- you need to have the Airpcap developer's pack in 
	  %BUILD_TREE%\Airpcap_Devpack
- you need to have the NpfIm compiled sources in
	  %BUILD_TREE%\NpfIm
	  You should also have run the "NpfIm\build_dev_pack.bat" script
	  to have the devpacks ready

How to compile WinPcap PRO (NOT for the Toolkit)
------------------------------------------------

1.  Download winpcap (HEAD) and winpcap_oem from the CVS into %BUILD_TREE%

2.  Modify the version info into
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\version.h. The version is x.y.2.z

3.  Modify the doxumentation version in the file
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\dox\prj\winpcap_oem_noc.dox
	  
4.  Modify the device string into
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\common\wpcapnames.h (first two defines)

5.  Download the libpcap sources (usually 0_9 branch) into 
	  %BUILD_TREE%\libpcap_<version>

6. Be sure that the sources of libpcap do *not* contain any CVS folder. The tarball usually
    contains the CVS folders if it's a daily snapshot. If any, remove them.

7.  Commit 

		%BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\version.h
		%BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\dox\prj\winpcap_oem_noc.dox 
	
	into the CVS. These should be the *only* modified filew in this module.

8.  Tag the %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem module with the tag 
	  WINPCAP_PRO_<WinPcap PRO version>_PUBLIC

9.  Tag the %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap module with the tag 
	  WINPCAP_PRO_<WinPcap PRO version>_PUBLIC

10. Take the contents of %BUILD_TREE%\libpcap_<version> and copy it into
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\wpcap\libpcap 

11. From the command line, go to folder 
      %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\wpcap\libpcap

12. On the command line, type "patch -p1 < remote_code.patch"

13. CD into %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\wpcap\prj and execute 
	"build_scanner_parser.bat"	

13a. Check that the version of libpcap in
      %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\wpcap\libpcap\pcap.c line 865
      "static const char pcap_version_string[] = "libpcap version 0.9[.x]";"
    makes sense (??? WHAT DOES IT MEAN???)

13b. Check that the version of wpcap in  
      %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap\wpcap\libpcap\pcap.c line 875
        "static const char wpcap_version_string[] = "3.1";"
    is correct. 
    
14. Zip the contents of the six folders 
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap
	  %BUILD_TREE%\libpcap_<libpcap_version>
	  %BUILD_TREE%\Airpcap_Devpack
	  %BUILD_TREE%\NpfIm
		  |
		  V
	  %BUILD_TREE%\sources.zip

15. Open a Win 2000 DDK Free build environment. Go into 
	  %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\packetntx. 
	Execute "compileDriver.bat". Prefast 1.5.2402 should issue 9 warnings 
	(20061127). 
	Close the build environment.
    NOTE: DO NOT EXECUTE 15. and 16. and 17. at the same time, they overwrite files in 
    the build process that are incompatible between the two builds.

16. Open the WinNT4 DDK Release build environment. Go into 
      %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\packetntx. 
    Execute "compileDriver.bat". Close the build 
    environment. 
    NOTE: DO NOT EXECUTE 15. and 16. and 17. at the same time, they overwrite files in 
    the build process that are incompatible between the two builds.

17. Open the Windows Server 2003 Free x64 build environment. Go into 
      %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\packetntx. 
    Execute "compileDriver.bat". Close the build 
    environment. 
    NOTE: DO NOT EXECUTE 15. and 16. and 17. at the same time, they overwrite files in 
    the build process that are incompatible between the two builds.


SIGNED BINARIES BUILD

   18s. Open %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\WinPcap OEM.sln with Visual Studio 2003. 
     Choose the "Release SIGNED STEP1" configuration, and then use Build->Rebuild Solution.
     No warnings should be generated.

   19s. Sign all the binaries in 
		%BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\OEM\WinPcapOem\Binaries_SIGNED, namely
			npfnt.sys
			npf2k.sys
			npfx64.sys
			packetnt.dll
			packet2k.dll
			packetVista.dll
		with the company certificate + cross certificate
		
		The generic command is
		   signtool sign /v /ac MSCV-VSClass3.cer /s my /n "CACE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC"
		   /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timestamp.dll <binary_name>
		   
   20s. Go back to Vistual studio 2003. Choose the "Release SIGNED STEP2" configuration, and then
     use Build->Rebuild solution. Some warnings should be generated when compiling wpcap.dll.

	21s. Sign the following binaries in 
		%BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\OEM\WinPcapOem\Binaries_SIGNED\packet.dll
		%BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\OEM\WinPcapOem\Binaries_SIGNED\wpcap.dll
		with the company certificate + cross certificate


   21s. The build is complete. Check the versions *and* signature of the
   following files:
		%BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\OEM\WinpcapOem\Binaries_SIGNED\wpcap.dll
		%BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\OEM\WinpcapOem\Binaries_SIGNED\packet.dll

UNSIGNED BINARIES BUILD

18u.  Open %BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\WinPcap OEM.sln with Visual Studio 2003. 
     Choose the "Release" configuration, and then use Build->Rebuild Solution.
     Some warnings should be generated when compiling wpcap.dll.

19u. The build is complete. Check the versions of the following files
		%BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\wpcap\PRJ\release_REMOTE\wpcap.dll
		%BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\OEM\WinpcapOem\Release\packet.dll
		%BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem\OEM\WinpcapOem\binaries\npf2k.sys

How to create the developer's pack for WinPcap PRO (NOT for the Toolkit)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. After the build is complete, in a command prompt go to 
		
		%BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem

2. Run "build_wpdpack_oem.bat". The script will perform these
	steps without pauses:
	a. Creation of the include folder (no errors/warnings)
	b. Creation of the lib folder (no errors/warnings)
	c. Creation of the bin folder (no errors/warnings)
	d. Creation of the Examples and Examples-pcap folders (no errors/warnings)
	e. creation of the documentation. One error copying some *.gif files is reported.

NOTE: the script gives precedence to the signed binaries, i.e. the ones in the 
      Binaries_SIGNED\ folder.

How to create the developer's pack for WinPcap PRO (NOT for the Toolkit) with NpfIm loading support (IBM)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. After the build is completed, in a command prompt go to 
		
		%BUILD_TREE%\winpcap_oem

2. Run "build_wpdpack_oem_with_npfim.bat". The script will perform these
	steps without pauses:
	a. Creation of the include folder (no errors/warnings)
	b. Creation of the lib folder (no errors/warnings)
	c. Creation of the bin folder (no errors/warnings)
	d. Creation of the Examples and Examples-pcap folders (no errors/warnings)
	e. creation of the documentation. One error copying some *.gif files is reported.
   f. copy of the NpfIm files.

NOTE: the script gives precedence to the signed binaries, i.e. the ones in the 
      Binaries_SIGNED\ folder.
